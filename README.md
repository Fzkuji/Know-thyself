# Know-thyself

Fine-tuning LLMs to develop metacognitive abilities - knowing what they know and don't know before making predictions.

## Overview

This project aims to enhance LLMs' self-awareness of their own capabilities. The goal is to train models that can accurately predict whether they will be able to correctly answer a given question before attempting to answer it.
